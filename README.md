# 🚗 EZPark – Smart Parking Finder App

## 📱 About the Project

EZPark solves the common problem of urban parking by transforming unused private spaces into rentable parking slots. Instead of searching endlessly for parking, users can simply open EZPark, find a nearby spot on the map, and book it instantly — while homeowners earn by renting their space.
